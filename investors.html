                                <br></br>

                                <p>Unlike other investments, real estate provides 4 ways in which you can make 
                                money. Spoiler alert: you can’t see most of the money that makes it into your 
                                pocket. Compared to stocks and bonds, real estate provides far greater benefits 
                                at the cost of liquidity.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p><b>Cash Flow</b> - your tenants will pay you rent every month, regardless if 
                                you had to do any work to the property or not. This is the most obvious profit 
                                center, and the most controllable. Because we never want to pay out of pocket to 
                                keep an investment afloat, we should always invest for cash flow. Make sure that 
                                the rental income covers your mortgage payment, maintenance and repairs to the 
                                property, property management to automate your business, and then some so you can 
                                save for your next investment.</p>

                                <p><b>Market Appreciation</b> - historically, real estate has appreciated 5% on

                                the financial crisis in 2007, but overall the market always recovers, especially 
                                when your property is positioned in a highly desirable area. Location, location,

                                By matching what similar properties in your neighborhood have, you can increase the 
                                value of your home by thousands with a few simple touchups.</p>

                                <p><b>Equity Position</b> - every month that you pay the mortgage, you’ll gain equity 
                                in the house. Once you get to the end of your mortgage term (typically 30 years), 
                                you’ll own the house free and clear. Pro tip: pay half of the mortgage twice a month 
                                to artificially knock a few years off your loan term. Staying on top of this every 
                                month will save you thousands in interest payments. Once you have enough equity in a 
                                property, you have the right to take out a home equity line of credit (HELOC). This will 
                                allow you use your current property as collateral to buy another investment. See how

                                <p><b>Tax Savings</b> - as a business owner, you’re eligible to deduct any expenses 
                                associated with operating your business on your tax return. This includes any repairs or 
                                improvements (but not additions), vehicle miles to and from the property, and professional 
                                fees like property management. You can also take advantage of the 1031 exchange, which is 
                                one of the most powerful tax shelters allowed for real estate. When you sell a stock and 
                                you’ve made money on it, you’re required to pay capital gains tax at the highest rate. The 
                                opposite is true in real estate. This IRS law stipulates that if you sell your existing 
                                property, identify a replacement property within 45 days, and purchase another property within 
                                180 days, all capital gains are deferred and you pay NO TAXES. If you do this continuously and 
                                keep trading up to larger property every year, you’ll never pay capital gains tax on it. You 
                                can start with a $50,000 single family home and end up with a $50 million apartment building 
                                without owing the IRS a dime.</p>

                            <p>Landlording can be fulfilling at times, but it can also come at a great cost. When you’re a landlord,

                            <b>What is an FHA loan?</b>

                            <p>An FHA loan is a mortgage that's insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). This is a powerful 
                            investment tool because it allows down payments of 3.5% for buyers with credit scores of 580+. For example, 
                            if you purchase a multi-family property for $500,000, your down payment is only $17,500 excluding closing 
                            costs. Because of the low initial investment, your return on investment will be artificially increased. The 
                            more leverage you use, the more money you can make.</p>

                            <p>However, there are several disadvantages to using an FHA loan. First, a transaction involving FHA typically 
                            takes a month longer than a traditional sale. This happens because FHA will need to send its own appraiser out 
                            (your mortgage lender will do this too) before approving your loan. Moreover, FHA stipulates that you must live 
                            on the property as your primary residence for at least 1 year. Afterwards, you can move out into another property 
                            that you buy. Additionally, borrowers must pay mortgage insurance premiums (MIP), which protects the lender if a 
                            borrower defaults. This usually adds several hundred dollars to your expenses and lowers your bottom line. On top 
                            of this, paying such a low down payment means that your monthly cash flow will also be lower than if you took out 
                            a conventional loan. This is usually not a problem, because you would have used my Real Estate Evaluator tool to 
                            calculate a healthy positive cash flow. Lastly, you can only take out 1 FHA loan at a time. If you want to utilize 
                            this tool for another property, you’ll need to reach 20% equity on your existing loan first.</p>

                            <b>What is a HELOC?</b>

                            <p>HELOC stands for home equity line of credit. Unlike a home equity loan, a HELOC allows the borrower to use only 
                            part of the available amount. You can use this to pay off high-interest credit cards, finance a home improvement 
                            project, or even to leverage your way into the next investment property. Remember that your rental properties gain 
                            equity every month the mortgage is paid, so your ability to buy the next investment snowballs with each additional 
                            property. This compounding effect allows you to purchase investments with little to no money down if you exercise 
                            patience. Another great benefit of taking out a HELOC is that the interest may be tax-deductible. Be sure to ask 
                            your tax professional for more information before using this investment tool. On the other hand, an investor should 
                            be aware that HELOCs are typically variable rate. Be sure to ask your mortgage professional if the rate offered is 
                            a discounted rate or an introductory rate.</p>
